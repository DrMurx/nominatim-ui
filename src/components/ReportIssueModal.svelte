          Before reporting problems please read the <a target="_blank" href="https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/">user documentation</a>
          and
          <a target="_blank" href="https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Faq/">FAQ</a>.

          If your problem relates to the address of a particular search result please use the 'details' link 
          to check how the address was generated before reporting a problem.

          Use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim/issues">Nominatim issues on github</a>
          to report problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please ensure that you include a full description of the problem, including the search
          query that you used, the problem with the result and, if the problem relates to missing data,
          the osm type (node, way, relation) and id of the item that is missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problems that contain enough detail are likely to get looked at before ones that require
          significant research.
